This is a C++ console-based Enhanced Task Management System developed as a student project. It allows users to create, manage, and track tasks efficiently with features like undo, task history, notifications, sorting, filtering, and dependency management. Various data structures are used in this project including stacks, queues, linked lists, vectors, and graphs. It also implements multiple sorting algorithms like Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort to organize tasks based on priority, deadlines, or names. This project helps beginners understand how to apply data structures and algorithms in real-life applications.
